			<h1>Hey, I'm tobezdev.</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my website! If this site doesn't look that good in
				your opinion, It's because I'm a backend developer. I don't have
				an artistic style or good design skills, so lower your
				expectations. With that being said, I hope you enjoy your stay!

						Hype Squad is a fancy way of saying 'Community Manager'
						- my roles here mainly consist of providing support to
						those who may need it, and to keep artists engaged with
						the platform. I've also assisted in some development
						aspects of the platform, including the website, custom
						$AUDIO Bot and the blockchain.

						I help passengers have a smooth and stress-free journey
						&mdash;  answering questions, giving travel advice, and helping
						with tickets or self-service machines. I'm there to keep
						things running smoothly around the station, make sure
						everyone feels welcome, and help sort out any small
						issues before they become big ones. It's all about good
						vibes, clear info, and great customer service.
