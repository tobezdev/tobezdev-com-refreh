			<h1>Hey, I'm tobezdev.</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my website! If this site doesn't look that good in
				your opinion, It's because I'm a backend developer. I don't have
				an artistic style or good design skills, so lower your
				expectations. With that being said, I hope you enjoy your stay!

			<h2>Experience</h2>

			<h3>
				Hype Squad at

				<a href="https://audius.co/" target="_blank" style="color: #ba7dff">Audius</a>
				(Jul 2025 - Present)
			</h3>
			<p>
				Hype Squad is a fancy way of saying 'Community Manager' - my
				roles here mainly consists of providing support to those who may
				need it, and to keep artists engaged with the platform. I've
				also assisted in some development aspects of the platform,
				including the website, custom $AUDIO Bot and the blockchain.z
			</p>

				Gateline & Platform Operations Assistant at

				<a href="https://southwesternrailway.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #0092cb">South Western Railway</a>
				(Jun 2025 - Sept 2025)
			</h3>
			<p>
				This role was mainly a customer-facing one, where I provided
				support to users of the rail network where it was needed.
				Sometimes, this would be simple enquiries; other times it would
				be checking railcards or enforcing revenue protection.

				Security Developement Partner at
				<img src="./assets/curity-logo.jpeg" alt="Curity Logo" id="ex-a-logo"/>
				<a href="https://curity.io/" target="_blank" style="color: #20242e">Curity</a>
				(Apr 2024 - Jun 2025)
			</h3>
			<p>
				The complex security analysis for this position were
				challenging, but allowed Curity to provide a live feed for
				various types of security vulnerabilities to businesses before
				they could be exploited by malicious actors.
